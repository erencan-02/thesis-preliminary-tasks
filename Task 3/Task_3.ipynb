    "# Task 3 - Point Cloud Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing large-scale point cloud scenes is important when qualitatively evaluating predictions from a machine learning model or exploring what is happening in an outdoor scene. To this end, using Python and Open3D (http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html), implement a visualization of a LiDAR point cloud sequence from the SemanticKITTI dataset. Your implementation should 1) allow you to navigate forward and backward in time using the left and right arrow keys, and 2) visualize the semantic labels for each point. An example visualization is shown in the following video (semantic labels on the left): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZGAK3XpX0."
